Turn ACF repeaters into tabs for a compact way to manage repeating data.  

## Usage

Enable per repeater in the ACF field group settings.

A new setting is added above 'Conditional Logic' where you can select from 3 layout options:

* Off
* Vertical
* Horizontal

## Simplify your admin UI

Tabs are housed vertically or horizontally.  

Tab labels can be taken from a text field within each tab (set 'Collapsed' repeater option).  

Drag and drop to re-order.  

Works great nested.

Set the repeater's label to blank for a seamless edge-to-edge layout.

Works best with Block Layout.

## Requirements

* ACF 5 or later
* Wordpress 3.8 or later
* PHP 5.6 or later

## Compatability

Tested with Wordpress 5.8.1 and ACF 5.10.2
